      <h1>Boba Places on the Ave!</h1>
      <p>As a boba connessieur, I drink a lot of boba and have visited many
        spots in the greater Seattle area! Here is some of my top choices if
        you're bringing a friend and they wanna check out the good bubble tea
        in the area.

        <h2>TP Tea, 5/5</h2>
        <p>TP Tea still remains as my favorite boba place! Although it can be
          a bit pricier because of the credit card fee and how the toppings are
          a little more expensive, it's still my favorite. The tea quality
          is really smooth and you can taste the tea flavor. The QQ noodle
          and the golden jelly are my favorite toppings still, and it's great
          that they have coffee jelly! I also like how their default tea is a
          variation of oolong tea. My favorite drinks are the 3Q TP Milk Tea and
          the Fresh Fruit Tea with Chia Seeds and golden jelly. I like how I
          can get no sugar and no ice and still find the drink appetizing!</p>
